# This script is a workaround for:
# https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=707899#c4
# It requires tmux to be installed.

# Essentially, spawning e.g. `gnome-terminal --command vim` will not behave as
# you expect: the vim process is actually owned by gnome-terminal-server, and
# the gnome-terminal process itself exits right away. This makes it useless in
# situations where we want to determine when vim exits by waiting on
# gnome-terminal.

# The hack implemented here uses tmux to create a new session containing the
# process we want to execute, spawn gnome-terminal to attach to it, and then
# block until the started process finishes.
